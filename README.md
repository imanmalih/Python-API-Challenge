Our analysis on the first scatter plot "City Max Latitude vs Temperature", it does not show a strong correlation between the latitude and the temperature. 
Although there are some strong correlation, it is not enough to determine if the temperature is hotter closer to the equator. 
The same determination can be made for the latitude vs the humidity. 
There is not a strong correlation between the humidity and the equator/latitude. The higher humidity percentage is mainly in between the -40 latitude and 60 latitude. 
For the relevance of cloudiness and the windness vs the latitude, there seems to be a weak correlation. 
There seems to be a significant amount of cloudy skies and wind speeds in the ranges of 5 to 60 latitude. 

To plan a future vacation based off the weather predications, we narrowed down our data frame to find the locations with the best weather for an ideal vaction. 
With temperatures between 80(F) to 60(F) and low wind speeds, our image shows a great amount of locations that fit the criteria.
To take it a step further we got the first hotel in a 10,000 miles radius per city.
